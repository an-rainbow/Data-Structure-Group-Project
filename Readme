Additional Feature
For this feature, our program displays to the console the total livable area per capita for the ZIP Code which has the minimum total fines per capita. 
Firstly, we calculate the total fines per capita for each ZIP Code (i.e. the total aggregate fines divided by the population of that ZIP Code), find 
the minimum result and mark the ZIP Code of the minimum result as minZipCode. Secondly, we calculate the total livable area per capita for the minZipCode 
(i.e. the total livable area in the minZipCode divided by the population of minZipCode). The Data of fines is provided in the parking violations input file, 
the data of population is provided in the population input file, and the data of livable area is provided in the property values input file.

Data Structure used: TreeMap, HashMap, ArrayList
